Get ready to dive into the vibrant and unexpected world of Tagata Honen Matsuri – Japan's wackiest fertility festival! If you thought you've seen it all in Japan, think again. March 15th in Komaki, just north of Nagoya, is the date when this wild celebration takes center stage at the Tagata Shrine.

## What's the Buzz About?

 So, what's the fuss about? Tagata Honen Matsuri is all about fertility, harvest, and prosperity, but with a quirky twist. Imagine a lively procession featuring a massive wooden phallus parading from one shrine to another. Oh, and did we mention the colorful floats, phallic-shaped lollipops, and chocolate-covered bananas?

## Getting in the Spirit

 As you stroll towards Tagata Shrine, you'll pass food stalls with your typical festival treats, but here, they've got phallic-themed goodies that'll make you do a double take. The shrine, dating back 1500 years, is adorned with phallic-shaped rocks and wooden members of various sizes. Worshippers of all ages line up to ring a rather unconventional bell and offer their prayers after rubbing the tip of a statue.

## The Main Attraction

 The festival kicks off with a taiko performance and floats decked out in paper streamers. But hold onto your sake cups, because the real star of the show is a 280 kg wooden phallus housed in a portable shrine. Crafted with love every year, the previous year's masterpiece is auctioned off – talk about a unique conversation starter!

## Join the Fun

 Now, here's where it gets interactive. Enthusiastic men, all aged 42, hoist the mikoshi onto their shoulders, carrying the phallus to the main shrine. Legend has it that this act brings them luck in an otherwise inauspicious year. Sake flows freely, adding to the merriment. Join the parade, keep pace with the sake cart, and you might find yourself making friends while savoring snacks.

## The Climax and a Solid Surprise

 At the main shrine, the phallus finds its home for the year. The grand finale? Mochi nage – officials tossing supposedly lucky rice cakes from raised platforms. It's a free-for-all as the crowd scrambles to catch them. Just a heads up, though – the rice cakes might be rock solid and not the tastiest treat!

## Why You Shouldn't Miss It

 This festival is a testament to the Japanese letting loose. The atmosphere is a mix of joy, laughter, and friendly faces – from families with kids to elderly couples enjoying novelty lollipops. The sun shines, music plays, sake flows, and everyone is in an exceptionally good mood.

So, mark your calendars for March 15th, hop on a train to Tagata Shrine, and experience a festival that's not just about fertility but also about letting your hair down and having a blast. Trust us; it's a day you won't forget. And remember, stick close to the sake cart – you won't regret it!
