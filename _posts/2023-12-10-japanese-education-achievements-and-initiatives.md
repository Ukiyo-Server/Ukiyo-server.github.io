## Japanese Students Achieve High Rankings in Global Survey

Japanese students have achieved their highest ranking ever in reading literacy, placing third globally according to a recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The survey, part of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022, covered approximately 690,000 students aged 15 from 81 countries and regions.

Japan's remarkable improvement in reading literacy, from 15th in the 2018 survey to third, is accompanied by high rankings in science (second) and mathematics (fifth). The implementation of curriculum guidelines focusing on thinking skills development and the shorter duration of pandemic-related school closures in Japan are seen as key factors in this success.

## Japan's Plan for Tuition-Free University Education

In another significant educational development, the Japanese government is planning to make university tuition and related expenses free for households with three or more children, starting from fiscal 2025. This initiative is part of broader measures to address the country's declining birthrate and aims to alleviate the financial burden of education on families. The program will have no income limit and is a crucial element of the government's strategy to enhance children's futures.
